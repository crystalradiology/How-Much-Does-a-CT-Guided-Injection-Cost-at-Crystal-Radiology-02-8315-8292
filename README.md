Understanding CT Guided Injections

Interventional radiology, particularly CT-guided and ultrasound-guided injections, plays a crucial role in modern medical diagnostics and treatments. These procedures are used to treat various conditions by accurately delivering medication to specific areas of the body. The precision of these methods ensures effective pain relief and treatment of underlying issues.

What is an Injection?

In the context of interventional radiology, an injection involves administering medication directly into a targeted area using imaging guidance. This approach enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of the treatment, reducing the risk of complications and improving patient outcomes. Interventional CT and ultrasound-guided injections are commonly used to manage pain and treat inflammatory conditions in joints, muscles, and nerves.

What Happens During My Injection?

When you arrive for your injection, you'll be guided through the following steps:

1.       Preparation: You will be asked to sit or lie down, depending on the region of the body where the injection is needed. The medical team will position you to ensure optimal access to the injection site.

2.       Procedure: The radiologist uses either a CT scanner or ultrasound machine to guide the needle to the correct area. This involves creating a small puncture in the skin through which the needle or catheter is inserted. The most common interventional procedures include pain blocks, nerve injections, epidural injections, and facet joint injections.

3.       Immobility: During the injection, it’s crucial to remain as still as possible to ensure precision. The imaging equipment provides real-time visuals, helping the radiologist to guide the needle accurately.

4.       Completion: Once the medication is administered, the needle is carefully withdrawn, and a small bandage is applied to the injection site. The entire process typically takes between 10 to 20 minutes for CT-guided injections and 5 to 10 minutes for ultrasound-guided injections, depending on the area being treated.

Types of Injections
